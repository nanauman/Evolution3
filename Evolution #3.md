# Evolution #3 Software and Systems

## What do you know? - General:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's business climate, proficiency in software and systems is essential for success in almost all facets of business as technology becomes increasingly integrated with day to day operations. The coding system I have had the most experience with in this program is Python. The foundation of my knowledge came from CIDM 6303 and using the Code with Mosh. During this program basics like Python Variables, comments, Strings(their formatting and how to use them in methods), working with numbers in python and converting strings to numbers. [[Primitive Types Example]](https://github.com/nanauman/Evolution3/blob/main/Python%20Code%20with%20Mosh%20Examples/Code%20with%20Mosh%20-%20Primitive%20Types.jpg) Controlling program flow was also covered under Code with Mosh and we covered the following, Comparison operators (>,<, =), Using Conditional statements(IF), Logical Operators, For Loops, For/Else Loops, using the Break statement, and While Loops. [[Control Flow Example]](https://github.com/nanauman/Evolution3/blob/main/Python%20Code%20with%20Mosh%20Examples/Code%20with%20Mosh%20-%20Control%20Flow.jpg) Functions and their arguments and class creation were also covered in Code with Mosh[[Functions Example]](https://github.com/nanauman/Evolution3/blob/main/Python%20Code%20with%20Mosh%20Examples/Code%20with%20Mosh%20-%20Functions.jpg) Some deeper topics were covered with Code with Mosh and they include Packages, import other modules[[Modules Example]](https://github.com/nanauman/Evolution3/blob/main/Python%20Code%20with%20Mosh%20Examples/Code%20with%20Mosh%20-%20Modules.jpg), working with outside file types like ZIP, CSV, JSON and SQL, working with time and date, and generating random values(Python Standard Library Example). I also learned how to create and work within virtual environments. The last major area that was covered under Code With Mosh was data structures within Python, we covered Lists(and how to manipulate them), looping with lists, mapping and filtering, tuples, arrays and dictionaries(Data Structures Example) I had two more experiences handling data structures in Python using the Packages Pandas and Numpy. My Pandas experience came from both CIDM 6351 & CIDM 5310 (Pandas Examples) and Numpy came from CIDM 6351 via the SoloLearn course Python for Data Science. (Certificate) These packages are useful in managing high volumes of data, connecting to a database, as well as analyzing and then visualizing the data. The final project of CIDM 5310 was a really good experience as we created a database using Pandas in Python, connected the database to a server, created users for the database, and finally used that data to tell a story using data analytics. (CIDM 5310 Final) With this array of experience I feel very confident in my abilities to use Python in an entry level professional setting allowing me to expand on my base knowledge. I feel confident in my base knowledge of Python that with proper research I could figure out how to do most things in the system even without prior experience. 


## Where are you weak?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I have a good base of knowledge regarding all of the programming languages introduced throughout this program, I still need more first hand experience dealing with complex issues that require complex coding solutions. Also these complex issues may not necessarily have a defined solution as things do in education. I completely understand the need for this when learning a new coding language however I know real-world applications generally do not have pre-defined solutions and require a little more creativity and trial & error. I do believe this final project is a good step towards a more real life type project as there isn’t really a predefined correct answer, and I think a lot of my desired experience would come from future job experience that would allow me to use and expand my base knowledge. Another item I plan on addressing with this final project is expanding my CSS (HTML Styling) skillset. While I have a basic understanding of CSS techniques I have a lot more to learn if I want to make professional looking web pages. I certainly want to incorporate some professional looking CSS styling into my final project

## What don’t you know?:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think my biggest blindspot in my Software and Systems experience would be a lack of any experience coding with Java. I am unsure if there was a course or courses that gave this experience but it is certainly an area I need to strengthen on my own. I know Java is very popular among organizations and they are frequently looking for individuals with Java experience so in order to make myself a more desirable candidate (and in turn give myself more opportunities) learning Java basics would be extremely beneficial. If there is a way to incorporate Java into the final project, I would love to integrate it. While I know there are a lot of other programming languages that I have not learned, however, based on popularity I think I would be well rounded enough having Python and Java experience covered.  

## Integration with the other 3 evolutions:
### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evolution #1: Data Analytics:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software and systems work hand and hand with each evolution, in fact the argument could even be made that the software and systems evolution has the most direct interactions with all of the other evolutions. Starting with analytics, software plays a critical role in a myriad of ways. First off, almost all data analysis performed in the business world today is conducted in some sort of analytics software. These softwares play huge roles by first providing the user an interface to create their analysis, and then connect to the appropriate databases to pull the necessary data for analysis. This process would take countless man hours to pull data and conduct the analysis for a mediocre sized database without appropriate software. A large sized database would be virtually impossible to do without some software assistance. The software is able to work with (retrieve and analyze) high volumes of data substantially faster and more accurately than humans. Software can also help with visualization involving data analysis including creating dashboards, charts, graphs and other visualizations tactics. These softwares can also run some of the more repetitive tasks automatically like weekly reporting, saving users time and ultimately allowing them to make better data-driven decisions. Software also plays a huge role in data acquisition by collecting data from various interactions across the organization. 

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evolution #3: Software and Systems:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All data management methods rely on robust data software. These tools, like SQL, allow organizations to store extremely large volumes of data, retrieve data, and manipulate that data. These software tools also help organizations meet legal requirements for data protection and security standards. Data management software can also assist in integrating the database into other programs for either use of the data(like conducting reporting or analysis), or collecting data and adding it to the appropriate location in the database. This allows for real time updating letting analysis be more accurate. Another potential integration using data management software  would be to connect the database to a server.  In today’s business environment it is almost impossible to manage the amount of data available without the assistance of software.


### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evolution #4: Network and Cyber Security:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software plays a major role in security, being used to monitor network layout, firewalls, locate any potential threats or vulnerabilities and assist in securing and encrypting communications. All networking and cyber security activities would be virtually nonexistent without the use of software. Ironically softwares(networking and otherwise) are the source of most potential threats and vulnerabilities, but then using softwares is also the best way to protect against those threats. Security softwares would also include any software that helps create roles and secure logins and permissions.
